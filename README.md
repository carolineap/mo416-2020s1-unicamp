## Project 1 - Search Algorithms

To implement and evaluate solutions based on search methods for the problem described in [Project 1 PDF](p1.pdf) using the AIMA
function library (https://github.com/aimacode/aima-python/blob/master/search.ipynb). This project aims in
providing the solution implemeted with the following:

- Two search methods without information
- Two informed search methods with 2 distinct heuristics
- One local search method

The work consists of finding an adequate solution to the chosen problem, evaluating it according to: computational
cost, completeness, optimality. Your are required to clearly define:

- How the problem was modeled
- Implementation specifics and restrictions

## Project 1 - Division of Tasks
Caroline Silva contributed with the base code structure, the DFS, BFS and Greedy search algorithms, Manhattan Heuristic and graphical visualization.

Gabriel Previato contributed with the A* search, the Wavefront Heuristic and the Simulated Annealing.

Thales Oliveira contributed with the A* search, the Ghost Avoidance Heuristic and Hill-Climbing.

Let√≠cia Berto contributed with the Mazes creation, experiments executions, graphical visualization and the solution video.

All of the above mentioned contributed in the analysis and final report.
